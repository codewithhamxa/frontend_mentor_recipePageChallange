### What I learned

Throughout this project, I learned how to use semantic HTML5 markup effectively to create a well-structured and accessible web page. Additionally, I explored custom CSS properties to enhance the design and improve user experience.

Here are some code snippets I'm proud of:

```html
<div class="wrapper">
    <img src="omelette.jpg" alt="Omelette">
    <div class="content">
        <h1>Simple Omelette Recipe</h1>
        <p>An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal. This classic omelette combines beaten eggs cooked to perfection, optionally filled with your choice of cheese, vegetables, or meats.</p>
        ...
    </div>
</div>
